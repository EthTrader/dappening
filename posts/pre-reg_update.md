The EthTrader DAO, registry, and token are vehicles for expanding this subreddit with Ethereum-based functionality. The initial scope is focused on the establishment of a self-governing dao, a voting dapp, and a browser plugin to id other registered users and allow simple but true decentralised interaction (like tipping). Future developments will be chosen by the dao and could take any number of directions from [specialty tokens](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7d2epl/my_2_gweis_about_how_i_see_this_community/dpume4l/), badges, gamified ico reviews, token weighted project ranking, or whatever else the community decides. Any reddit user who has commented or posted on r/ethtrader, r/ethereum, r/ethdev, or r/ethermining is eligible will be able to register their reddit username with the dao-controlled on-chain registry if they have **first** [pre-registered an ethereum account](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=EthRegBot&message=!ethreg%200xANETHADDRESSHERE&subject=pre-register).

To date, 389 users, representing 16.3% of ethtrader karma, have pre-registered. **Thank you for your support and for taking the time!** Pre-registration is still open and the karma and user snapshot* has been updated so that new users since 30/09/2017 can [pariticpate](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=EthRegBot&message=!ethreg%200xANETHADDRESSHERE&subject=pre-register) (actually the snapshot is not *quite* finished so karma scores might not be fully accurate and if your name is not found try again after i notify that it *is* complete). There are currently enough [funds](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf7927bf0230c7b0e82376ac944aeedc3ea8dfa25) to supply 3300 new pre-registered addresses with $0.10 each to cover the registration and some additional tx. The dao can open new reg periods but doing so is at the discretion of dao voters (registered users), who will also determine the terms of that reg period.

**Instructions**

* [Request your karma score (this should compare reasonably closely to your score as Reddit reports it to you)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=EthRegBot&message=!ethreg%20karma&subject=karma)
* [Pre-register](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=EthRegBot&message=!ethreg%200xANETHADDRESSHERE&subject=pre-register) (need to replace "0xANETHADDRESSHERE" with your ETH address! you can create a new one use [MEW](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)).

**Background**

* [Original "The Dappening" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/72scaj/ethtrader_the_dappening/)
* [The Dappening progress report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/75a2f3/the_dappening_progress_report_registration/)
* [Dao & Token salient contract features](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/78xelg/ethtrader_token_dao_salient_features/)
* [Pre-reg announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/79osxq/ethtrader_dao_token_preregistration/)
* [Pre-reg update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7a33tw/update_ethtrader_dao_token_preregistration/)


*Reddit doesn't break down your karma by sub (publically) so a [script](https://github.com/EthTrader/karma) pulls from their api and does this itself (takes ~5days)
