Dappening: Progress report, registration process, and testnet demo

The Dappening is an experiment within the Reddit Ethereum community to explore how these two tools could be used for further mutual benefit. Since the original [dappening thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/72scaj/ethtrader_the_dappening/) some progress has been made in the areas deemed necessary to begin this experiment, largely with regard to the tools and procedure necessary for a registration process. The goals of the registration process are to:

1. Allow users from 4 ethereum related subs (r/ethereum, r/ethtrader, r/ethdev, and r/ethermining) to self-register their Reddit usernames along with start date, karma for posts and comments, and mod status.
1. Expose this data for consumption by future smart contracts and dapps.

**How can Reddit users self-register their data?**

Using merkle trees. 



* Stats collected are valid through 30/9/2017
* [57,915] eligible users from r/ethereum, r/ethtrader, r/ethdev, and r/ethermining
* karma from 96,814 posts (1,959,963) and 1,876,562 comments (5,924,793) collected
